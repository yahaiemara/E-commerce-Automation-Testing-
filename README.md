🧪 Automation Testing Project Summary
This project is a test automation framework built using Selenium WebDriver for automating UI testing of a web application. The framework follows best practices in automation architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and readability.

✅ Key Features:
Selenium WebDriver: Used for automating browser actions and simulating real user interactions.

TestNG: Test framework for managing test execution, grouping, assertions, and parallel execution.

Allure Reports: Integrated to generate detailed, visual test reports including steps, screenshots, and logs.

Logging: Custom logging implemented to track execution flow and debugging information.

Design Pattern: Implemented the Page Object Model (POM) to separate page locators and actions, promoting code reuse and clean structure.
